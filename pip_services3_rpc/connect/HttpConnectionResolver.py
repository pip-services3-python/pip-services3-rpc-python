    Helper class to retrieve connections for HTTP-based services abd clients. In addition to regular functions of ConnectionResolver is able to parse http:// URIs and validate connection parameters before returning them.

    ### Configuration parameters ###

    - connection:
        - discovery_key:               (optional) a key to retrieve the connection from IDiscovery
        - ...                          other connection parameters
    - connections:                   alternative to connection
        - [connection params 1]:       first connection parameters
